\begin{abstract}
	Over its approximately 100 year history stellar modeling has become an
	essential tool for understanding certain astrophysical phenomena which are not
	directly observable. Modeling allows for empirical constraints --- such as
	elemental abundances, luminosities, and effective temperatures --- to strongly
	inform non-observables such as a star's age, mass, and radius. Here we propose a
	thesis in five parts, related through their use of both modeling and the
	Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program (DSEP) to conduct this modeling. In two of
	the parts of this thesis we will use DSEP, in conjunction with atmospheric
	boundary conditions generated by collaborators, to build chemically
	self-consistent models of multiple populations (MPs) in the globular clusters
	NGC 2808, 47 Tuc, and NGC 6752. We will infer helium abundances across MPs and
	compare these inferred abundances to those from models which do not consider as
	careful a handling of a star's chemistry. PLACEHOLDER
