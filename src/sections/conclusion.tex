\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
{\color{red} Here we have preformed the first chemically self-consistnent
modeling of the Milky Way Globular Cluster NGC 2808. We find that, updated
atmospheric boundary conditions and opacity tables do not have a significant
effect on the inferred helium abundances of multiple populations.}
