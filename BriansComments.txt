1. The abstract is too long and contains too much background information.  It
needs to focus on the results presented in this paper. [partial]
2. End of the introduction, it is important to note that we are modeling the
photometry (and looking for multiple populations in the photometry). [okay]
3.  Start of Section 2 - you need to introduce DSEP.  Also need that in the first sentence you need to say chemically consistent. [okay]
4. Section 2.1 — the key assumption we make is that the radiation is in
thermodynamic equilibrium (and so is described as a blackbody) and energy
transport by radiation is diffusive. For a citation, any textbook is fine (e.g.
Salaris & Cassisi, ‘Evolution of Stars and Stellar Populations’,  2005. (pages
52-54). [okay]
5. We can ask Greg to add in more details on the model atmospheres; don’t worry
about this now [okay]
6. You should include the actual abundances used to model populations A & E as
a table (and include a citation to the spectroscopic work).
7. Figures 2 and 3 are not referenced in the text (or I just missed it).  YOu
need to include a brief discussion and citation to the photometry that you are
using. [broken fig reference, fix]
8. What is ‘pi’ that is on the right axis of Figure 4?
9. Start of Section 5: Before doing the isochrone fitting, you need to justify
why we are only fitting 2 populations (ie: discuss the Findanka results to the
HUGS photometry
