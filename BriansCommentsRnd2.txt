- For Figure 5, I would just use \delta (F275W - F814W) and then explain in the
  figure legend that you are plotted the difference in color between the
  fiducial and the data.  For Figure 7, what are the colored lines on the left
  plot?  I think instead of perpendicular distance, the right plot in Figure 7
  should just show the difference in color, as you state in Figure 5.2 that the
  is an offset of 0.026 mag in F814W.  I am recalling  that the F606W
  magnitudes generally agree; correct me if I am wrong.

- Abstract — this should focus on the results that are presented in this paper,
  and do not need to include an introduction.  Thus, you can remove most of the
  first part of the abstract, and focus on the methods you used in this paper
  and the results that were obtained.  this would include discussing Findanka. [x]

- Line 56:  Do MPs really show up in the B filter?  I saw lots of B-V GC CMDs
  in the 1990s and none of them showed evidence for MPs.

- near the end of the introduction:  When you mention NGC 2808, you should
  discuss the photometry that we are using in this paper in a bit more detail.
  I am not exactly sure where, but at some point you also need to discuss what
  filters you elected to compare to our models. [x]

- Section 2.1:  You should discuss at what optical depth you match to theL
  surface boundary conditions.  You can also mention this in the caption to
  Figure 1. [x]

- Section 3, first paragraph: Usually, I mention the value of a solar
  calibrated mixing length (as there are many variations on exactly what flavor
  of mixing length are used in stellar interior codes),  However, I guess that
  you don’t have MARCS atmospheres for a solar composition?  If so, have you
  run a solar calibrated models with PHOENIX model atmospheres + OPLIB +
  AESOPUS-2.0?   Finally, instead of saying ‘high resolution mode’ you can
  mention the typical numerical tolerances which are used to solve the stellar
  structure equations, and the typical number of shells in a main sequence
  model. [x]

- End of Section 3:  You should have a transition sentence to the next section
  — basically telling the reader that you want to objectively determine which
  isochrones provide the best match to the photometry. [x]

- Line 291:  When you say ‘50th nearest stars’ I assume you mean in CMD space?
  You should define the distance that you are using in the text. [x]

- Figure 3:  I do not understand what you mean by “Lines show the density-color
  profile in each magnitude bin.” in the figure capture.  Please elaborate.

- Figure 4:  I am a bit confused by this figure; the joint distribution has
  fairly large ‘wings’ which I do not see in the individual components.  Can
  you explain? [the explination here is that BGMM modeling always fits a series of joint distributions ]

- End of section 4.1:  You need to explicitly state that you find photometric
  evidence for 2 populations in NGC 2808 when using your objective criteria,
  At this point, you can also discuss how this compares to what has been found
  previously in the literature (using ‘by eye’ methods) and also what people
  have found when looking at the spectroscopic  data.

- Section 4.4 needs to be fleshed out quite a bit more before sending to Greg.
  (ie: include your figure and tables, etc. ).  You also need to summarize the
  results of this tests — does Fidanka do a good job? [x]

- Section 5:  You need to provide more details — what exactly are the
  parameters of your best fitting isochrones, and provide numbers when
  comparing to previous work.

- Section 5.1:  Since the 0.02 mag offset is only showing up in 1 filter, in
  addition to the distance modulus (line 505) this could also affect the
  reddening value you find for the best fit isochrones.

- For your paper, you should also discuss how your helium abundances compare to
  what is found in the following:
